## Acknowledgments

At first I used `justify-self` and `align self` but changed that to `transform: translateX()` and `transform: translateY()` after watching part of Kevin Powell's video: [Taking on a FrontEndMentor.io challenge!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K27WULzr2P8). The result was better with transforms.
